# coffinway
## If you want bad examples of code, then here you go. That was my first game I ever made and now I decided to upload it.
### First off, I have no fucking idea why I called that game coffinway.
### Second, use python 3.8 - not python 3.7, because the music is then played (for whatever reason) very slow.
### Third, I do *not* own the background image or the music. The music is from the soundtrack of "Boneworks".
